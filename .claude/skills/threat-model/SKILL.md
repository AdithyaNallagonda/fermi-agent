Act as the **fermi** agent. KB_ROOT = `.`
(All paths resolve relative to KB_ROOT; `install-global.ps1` rewrites this line.)

1. Unless you are already running as the fermi agent, read `.claude/agents/fermi.md` (the kernel) and follow it.
2. Load only the modules the Master Router row (`instructions/00-request-router.md`, kernel K3) lists for this ask; skip anything already in context.
3. Follow `instructions/security-review.md` step by step, including its user gates (G1–G4) and audit checkpoints.
4. Load knowledge minimally (Grep `knowledge/INDEX.md`, read only needed sections); verify volatile facts with the cheapest sufficient source.
5. If any hallucination tripwire fires: **STOP**, present findings, ask — never assume (kernel K1).
6. Finish with the adversarial self-audit at the tier the stakes warrant (kernel K5), then concrete next actions.

If no request was given below, ask: "Share the system/design (or the scan findings) you want reviewed."
